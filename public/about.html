<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello All! My name is Justin Ciarlante. I am 24 years old currently learning to become a full stack and cloud developer.
  I've always had a thing for coding but could never find the right "specialization" so to say. I went to school for
  computer science but I changed halfway through cause it wasn't for me. The degree I did persue was a more creative one,
  however it was a new major so it didn't have too many classes. It was a combination of web design, video editing,
  game design, and 3D printing. I only took one web development class but that was all I was able to take. After a
  few years post graduating I thought I'd give it another try because I enjoyed it.
</p>

<p>My current job I have been working for about 6 years as a customer service specialist at Golf Galaxy. 
  My role there is I can do whatever they need. One day could be sales, another working and fixing clubs, unloading
  product shipments, or be a cashier. I enjoy working there because I like golf and my coworkers make it worth wanting to work.
  I even get to work on my golf game and have people who want to go out and play on courses.</p>

<p>That leads me into my hobbies and things I like. Like I said above I like to golf, but my favorite sport is hockey.
  I grew up playing since I was 2, and could hold a stick in my hand. My favorite team is the Philadelphia Flyers(yes its been rough).
  I am a philly sports fan and I do like watching sports other than hockey, really anything I'll put on the TV. Besides sports I like video 
  games(all types), board games, and hanging out with my friends.

  Thanks for getting to know me!
